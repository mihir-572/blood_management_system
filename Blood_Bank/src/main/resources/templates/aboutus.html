                        <h4>Blood Storage and shelf life</h4>
                        <p>
                            The storage and shelf life of blood and blood components are critical aspects of maintaining a safe and effective blood supply for medical treatments and emergencies. Whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, and platelets all have different storage requirements and shelf lives:
                            <br><strong>Blood:</strong>  Whole blood has a relatively short shelf life of about 35 to 42 days when stored at the appropriate temperature, typically between 1°C and 6°C (33.8°F to 42.8°F). This relatively short shelf life is due to the various components within whole blood, such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma, which have different degradation rates.
                            <br><strong>Red Blood Cells (RBCs):</strong> Red blood cells can be stored for a longer period than whole blood. Typically, they can be stored for up to 42 days at the same temperature range of 1°C to 6°C. This extended shelf life allows for better inventory management and distribution.
                            <br><strong>Plasma: </strong>Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and thawed plasma have different storage requirements. Fresh frozen plasma can be stored for up to a year when kept at -18°C (-0.4°F) or lower. Once thawed, it should be used within 24 hours. Thawed plasma has a shelf life of up to 5 days when refrigerated at 1°C to 6°C.
                            <br><strong>Platelets:</strong> Platelets have the shortest shelf life of all blood components, typically around 5 to 7 days when stored at room temperature with gentle agitation. Due to their short shelf life, platelets need to be continuously supplied and used promptly.
                            <br>Proper storage and monitoring of blood components are essential to maintaining their quality and safety. Blood banks and healthcare facilities must adhere to strict regulations and guidelines to ensure that blood.products are administered before their expiration dates, reducing the risk of transfusion-related complications and ensuring the safety of recipients. Timely utilization and rotation of blood supplies are essential to minimize waste while maximizing the availability of safe blood products for patients in need.
